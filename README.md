# Stuck-On-Hold
This is the beginning of an App that will activate when a caller is placed on hold and notify them when they are taken off hold. It will utilize flow charts and UML from draw.io. I will be using SQL Server for my database and Visual Studio 2017 for my .NET/C# code.


<ul>
  <li>"I'm Stuck On Hold" is a draw.io flowchart of the program</li>
  <li>"Wireframes" is the draw.io file containing the in-progress wire frames for the project</li>
</ul>
